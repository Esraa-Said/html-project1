          <h3> Artificial intelligence (AI)</h3>
           is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.<br>
             The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.<br>
              Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency.<br>
               Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.

         <dl>
             <dt>
              1-  Weak AI or Narrow AI
             </dt>
             <dd>
                Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.<br>
                The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.
             </dd>
             <dt>
            2-  General AI
             </dt>
             <dd>
                General AI is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.
             </dd>
             <dt>
                3. Super AI
             </dt>
             <dd>
                Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties.

                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
                    Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.

                    2. Limited Memory
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.<br>
                    Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems.

                <dd>
                    Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans

                    These machines will be smarter than human mind.<br>
                    Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.
